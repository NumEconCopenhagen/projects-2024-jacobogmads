# Data Analysis Project

## Project Title
**Insights from Data: Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Modeling**

## About
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis using a dataset provided in `data.csv`. We also initiate an API from Statistics Denmark.

## Results
The findings and insights from the analysis are documented and can be explored by running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb). This Jupyter Notebook contains comprehensive analyses including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical tests to provide a robust understanding of the underlying data.

## Dependencies
Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following additional packages:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `seaborn`
