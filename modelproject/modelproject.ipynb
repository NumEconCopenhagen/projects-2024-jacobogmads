    "# Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta$: This represents the discount factor, denoting the preference of consumption today over consumption in the future. It ranges between 0 and 1, where a higher value of $\\beta$ indicates a stronger preference for current consumption relative to future consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "$n$: This parameter signifies the population growth rate or the growth rate of the labor force. It influences the overall growth rate of the economy and affects the dynamics of capital accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_t$: This denotes consumption at time $t$. It represents the portion of output or income that households consume rather than save. It plays a crucial role in determining the well-being or utility of individuals over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "$k_t$: This represents the capital stock at time $t$. Capital accumulation, along with technological progress, drives economic growth in the neoclassical growth model. The level of capital influences future production possibilities and thus affects consumption and investment decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\gamma$: The $\\gamma$ here appears in the expression for the transversality condition. It is a scalar that might reflect various factors, such as the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, the rate of time preference, or other structural parameters of the model. It ensures the condition holds as $T$ approaches infinity, ensuring the model's sustainability and consistency over time.\n"

    "The provided model is a so called Ramsey Growth Model, which includes time preferences in consumption optimisation and inter-temporal consumption choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The model aims to capture the dynamics of economic growth and the allocation of resources over time in an economy. It provides a framework for understanding how factors such as savings, investment, population growth, and technological progress interact to determine the long-run path of key macroeconomic variables like output, consumption, and capital accumulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preferences Equation ($U_0$):\n",
    "This equation represents the utility function of the representative agent in the economy. The agent aims to maximize the sum of discounted utility from consumption over an infinite time horizon. The utility function is logarithmic in consumption, implying diminishing marginal utility but a constant elasticity of intertemporal substitution due to the logarithmic form.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Constraints Equation:\n",
    "This equation reflects the intertemporal budget constraint of the economy. It states that the amount of consumption and investment (represented by $c_t$ and $k_{t+1}$ respectively) cannot exceed the total output of the economy at any given time $t$. Output is a function of the capital stock $k_t$ and is determined by a production function with constant returns to scale and a Cobb-Douglas form ($k_t^\\alpha$).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Transversality Condition:\n",
    "This condition ensures the sustainability of the economic model by asserting that the discounted value of future consumption relative to the value of the capital stock must approach zero as time extends to infinity. It prevents the economy from accumulating excessive levels of debt or capital that cannot be sustained indefinitely.\n"
